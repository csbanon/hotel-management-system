### Project Description
oléHotels is a Hotel Management System developed as part of the Processes of Object-Oriented Software Development (COP 4331C) course at the University of Central Florida.
This system handles the reservation of rooms and holds the customers’ information. It also holds room service requests, room cleaning requests, and prints itemized lodging receipts. If some room became recently vacant, a cleaning order is created by the system and a random worker is assigned to it. If the worker/cleaner logs into the system, she/he is able to see the work orders and they can mark it complete and write comments. The software also supports extra paid features for the hotel (i.e., parking, paid Wi-Fi, payTV, pool, etc.). The admin user is also able to see everything and assign rooms to specific customers.
